# Intent
My goal was to get some external API that I don't know anything about and try to see how the data is structured and then display that data. I was thinking about what I might use for my API and figured that using some weather API would be the best because they provide a lot of data in their requests and there are options for counseling on which one to use.  I have decided to use this weather API => [https://www.weatherapi.com/](https://www.weatherapi.com/). They provide a free package that has 1 million API calls and that was perfect for my little project.

# Process
Creating this project I was struggling with one thing. That thing was not technical but it was a question of how the website will look. Me not being a graphic designer, found this obstacle to be somewhat challenging. I have figured that I do not have to think of creative and intricate designs for this project because that was not a goal in the first place but to take a look at some other websites that do the same and get inspiration from them.

# End Result
The result was a website where you can search for any city in the world. The search bar comes with the suggestion of the system guessing what you might want to search for. You are shown a forecast for every hour for the 3 days. The website is also responsive for mobile users too!
